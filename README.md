# Reaction Paper about Alan Turing’s “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950)
# 
# Reading this paper today, it’s clear that Turing was far ahead of his time. His ideas form the intellectual foundation of modern AI. The Turing Test, while not without its critics, still serves as a benchmark for assessing machine intelligence. However, Turing’s optimism about machines thinking like humans brings up unresolved questions about the nature of consciousness. Even as AI progresses, it’s unclear whether machines will ever possess a true "mind" or if they will remain highly sophisticated tools. Nevertheless, Turing’s paper encourages us to push the boundaries of what we consider intelligence, challenging long-held assumptions about human uniqueness in the realm of thought.
